<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## üéÑ What it does
- This application features a carousel-based information display on multiple endangered species on our planet in the 21st century.
- This application features a working payment gateway to accept donations from the general masses who are willing to support the planet through financial support.
- This application features a working blog page that is constantly updated with stories that inspire and give hope.
- It also includes a facts section that is updated with quirky facts related to wildlife and our global ecosystem.

## üõ† How we built it
My application utilizes the following tech stack:

#### Frontend
- HTML / CSS: Simple markup and styling for Save-Thy-Planet application.
- EJS Templating Engine: Backend templating engine to render frontend from MongoDB Atlas.
- Vanilla JS: Plain JavaScript without any additional libraries.

#### Backend
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express.js: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for webapp development.
- MongoDB Atlas: Primary database to store authenticated users and violation reports.

#### Frameworks / Libraries
- Bootstrap: Mininal JS Framework for speedy frontend setup.
- Passport.js: Base library for Google OAuth.
- Passport-Google-OAuth: Used to set up Google Oauth inside our application.
- Mongoose ODM: Used to interact with MongoDB Atlas Cluster.
- Razorpay API: Used to set up payment gateway inside our application.
- JavaScript Maps API: Renders the global map with violation markers inside our application.
- HTML Geolocation API: Accesses current location of individual submitting the violation form on the backend.
